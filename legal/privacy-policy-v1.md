# Privacy Policy — Kitchen Hub

**Effective date:** February 15, 2026

This Privacy Policy describes how [Operator Name] ("we", "us", "our") collects, uses, and shares information when you use the Kitchen Hub mobile application and related services.

## 1. Who We Are

The data controller responsible for your personal data in connection with Kitchen Hub is [Operator Name]. You can contact us at **support@kitchenhub.com** for privacy-related questions or requests.

## 2. Data We Collect

We collect information necessary to provide and improve the Kitchen Hub service:

- **Account data:** Email address, name (if provided), and authentication identifiers (e.g. linked to Google sign-in) when you create or use an account.
- **Household and app data:** Household name, membership, and content you create in the app (shopping lists, list items, recipes, chores, dashboard data). We may also collect photos you add in the app (e.g. recipe images) to provide that functionality.
- **Device and technical data:** Device type, operating system, and app version may be collected for support and stability (e.g. crash reports if enabled). We do not use this data for advertising.
- **Usage data:** General usage of the app to operate and improve the service (e.g. API requests, sync events). Data is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.

## 3. How We Use Your Data

We use your data to:

- Provide, maintain, and improve the Kitchen Hub app (sync, households, lists, recipes, chores).
- Authenticate you and manage your account and household membership.
- Respond to support requests and communicate with you about the service.
- Ensure security, prevent abuse, and comply with legal obligations.

We do **not** use your data for cross-app tracking or third-party advertising. Data is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.

## 4. Legal Basis (Where Applicable)

Where required by law we rely on: (a) **contract** — to provide the service you requested; (b) **consent** — where we ask for it explicitly; (c) **legitimate interests** — to improve the service, security, and support, in a way that does not override your rights.

## 5. Data Sharing

We share personal data only as described below. We do **not** sell your personal data.

- **Service providers (processors):** We use trusted service providers who process data on our instructions. They do not use your data for their own purposes (e.g. advertising).
  - **Supabase:** We use Supabase for database and related infrastructure. Supabase acts as a **processor**, not a data controller — we instruct how your data is processed. Data transmitted to and from Supabase is **encrypted in transit (TLS)**. Data at rest is encrypted as described in Supabase’s documentation.
- **Legal and safety:** We may disclose data when required by law, to protect rights and safety, or to enforce our terms.

We do not use collected data for cross-app tracking or third-party advertising. Data is not used for advertising or marketing purposes.

## 6. Data Retention

We retain your data for as long as your account is active or as needed to provide the service, resolve disputes, and comply with legal obligations. You may request deletion of your account and associated data (see Your Rights below).

## 7. Your Rights

Depending on your location, you may have the right to:

- **Access** — request a copy of the personal data we hold about you.
- **Correction** — request correction of inaccurate data.
- **Deletion** — request deletion of your data and account. You can delete your account and associated data from the app, or request deletion by contacting us at **support@kitchenhub.com**.
- **Portability** — request a copy of your data in a portable format.
- **Object or restrict** — object to or request restriction of certain processing.
- **Withdraw consent** — where processing is based on consent.
- **Complain** — lodge a complaint with a supervisory authority in your jurisdiction.

To exercise these rights, contact us at **support@kitchenhub.com**. We will respond within the time required by applicable law.

## 8. Children

Kitchen Hub is not directed at children under the age required in your jurisdiction (e.g. under 13 in the US). We do not knowingly collect personal data from such children. If you believe we have collected data from a child, please contact us at support@kitchenhub.com and we will delete it.

## 9. International Transfers

Your data may be processed in countries other than your own. Where we transfer data from the EEA or UK, we use appropriate safeguards (e.g. standard contractual clauses or adequacy decisions) as required by law.

## 10. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a new effective date and, where required by law, notify you or ask for your consent. Continued use of Kitchen Hub after the effective date constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.
