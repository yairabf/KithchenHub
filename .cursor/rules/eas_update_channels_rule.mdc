# EAS Update Channels and Preview Profile (Locked)

When editing `mobile/eas.json`:

- **Channels:** Do not change `build.preview.channel` or `build.production.channel` unless the user has explicitly requested a change and approved the impact (OTA and environment semantics). Canonical values: `build.preview.channel` must remain `"develop"` (staging/testing); `build.production.channel` must remain `"main"` (production users). Changing channel names after builds are shipped can cause the wrong OTA updates to be delivered to staging vs production.
- **Preview distribution:** Do not change `build.preview.distribution` from `"internal"` without explicit approval. Internal distribution keeps preview (staging) builds installable on real devices via shareable URLs; changing to `"store"` would break that workflow.
- **Preview Android APK:** Do not remove or change `build.preview.android.buildType` from `"apk"` without explicit approval. APK is required for direct install on real Android devices without the Play Store.
- Any change to these values requires a formal product/engineering decision. To verify EAS config locally (channels, preview distribution, and Android APK), run `npm run verify:eas` from the `mobile` directory.
