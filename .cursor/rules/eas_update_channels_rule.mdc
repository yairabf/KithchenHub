# EAS Update Channels (Locked)

When editing `mobile/eas.json`:

- **Do not change** `build.preview.channel` or `build.production.channel` unless the user has explicitly requested a change and approved the impact (OTA and environment semantics).
- **Canonical values:** `build.preview.channel` must remain `"develop"` (staging/testing); `build.production.channel` must remain `"main"` (production users).
- Changing these channel names after builds are shipped can cause the wrong OTA updates to be delivered to staging vs production. Any change requires a formal product/engineering decision.
- To verify EAS config locally (including channel names), run `npm run verify:eas` from the `mobile` directory.
