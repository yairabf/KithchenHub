# Mobile App Identifiers (Locked)

When editing `mobile/app.json`:

- **Do not change** `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier` or `expo.android.package` unless the user has explicitly requested a change and approved the impact (App Store/Play Store continuity, OTA updates).
- **Canonical values:** Both must remain `com.kitchenhub.app` for all environments.
- Changing these identifiers after release breaks store listing continuity and over-the-air updates. Any change requires a formal product/engineering decision.
- To verify identifiers locally, run `npm run verify:identifiers` from the `mobile` directory.
