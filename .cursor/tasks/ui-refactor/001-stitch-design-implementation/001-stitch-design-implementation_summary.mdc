# 001 - Stitch Design Implementation - Implementation Summary

**Epic:** UI/UX Refactor
**Completed:** 2026-02-10
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Implemented
- **Theme Overhaul**: Updated `mobile/src/theme/colors.ts`, `shadows.ts`, and `typography.ts` to match the vibrant green and modern slate palette from the Stitch "kitchen" project.
- **Dashboard Refactor**: Updated `DashboardScreen` styles with glassmorphic cards (`surfaceGlass`), vibrant green accents for logos/profiles, and improved depth using `shadows.float`.
- **Shared Components**:
    - `ListItemCardWrapper`: Now defaults to `surfaceGlass` background and modern shadows.
    - `NavButton`: Colors updated to the new vibrant green palette.
    - `BottomPillNav`: Refined glass effect and shadows.
    - `ScreenHeader`: Added glassmorphism as the default header style.

## Deviations from Plan
- **Backdrop Filter**: I initially added `backdropFilter: 'blur(20px)'` to `DashboardScreen` styles, but removed it after seeing it caused a lint error (as it's not supported natively in standard React Native `ViewStyle`). The glass effect is achieved via `surfaceGlass` opacities instead.

## Testing Results
- **Visual Check**: The system tokens are consolidated. Changing `colors.primary` automatically updated buttons and active states.
- **Lint Check**: Resolved the `backdropFilter` issue.

## Lessons Learned
- When applying web-inspired designs (like Stitch desktop) to mobile, properties like `backdropFilter` need to be handled with care or substituted with platform-native alternatives (like `@react-native-community/blur` if available, though here we stuck to alpha colors for simplicity).

## Next Steps
- Apply the new "Vibrant Green" theme to the onboarding flow and authentication screens.
- Implement specialized "Glass" textures if the user wants more depth.
