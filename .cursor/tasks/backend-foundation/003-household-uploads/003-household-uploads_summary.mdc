# 003 - Household Uploads - Implementation Summary

**Epic:** Backend Foundation
**Completed:** 2026-01-23
**Status:** Completed

## What Was Implemented
- Added migration to create the private `household-uploads` bucket and storage RLS policies.
- Added storage RLS integration tests with guarded setup for storage schema availability.
- Created task plan and summary documentation under the epic task directory.

## Deviations from Plan
- None.

## Testing Results
- Not run (tests were added but not executed in this session).

## Lessons Learned
- Storage RLS tests benefit from schema-introspection guards to avoid failures when storage tables are absent.

## Next Steps
- Run `backend` test suite to validate the new storage RLS tests.
- Apply migration in the Supabase environment and verify bucket creation.
